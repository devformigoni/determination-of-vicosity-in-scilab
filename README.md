# determination-of-vicosity-in-matlab
# This is a code for a MATLAB function for calculating absolute viscosity using the Stokes method. The function inputs are the diameter of the sphere De, the mass and volume of the sphere mass_esf and vol_esf, the mass and volume of the fluid mass_fluid and vol_fluid, and the terminal velocity of the sphere v_term.
